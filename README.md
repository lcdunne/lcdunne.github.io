I am a software engineer with a PhD in psychology. During my studies, I discovered a passion for programming and have made extensive use of this for my research, hobbies, and for my work. I am particularly interested in data science/analysis, data visualisation, and back-end web development. I aim to further my skills and apply them to a meaningful cause.

# Experience

## Software Engineer, Reserve & Charge (2023 \- present)

I am part of a team building a cloud-based system that allows electric vehicle drivers to make advance parking reservations on charge points. This is a system of microservices spanning several languages and technologies: a combination of Python and Java for backend web servers, PostgreSQL for our databases, and Angular (Typescript) for the front-end. This also involves DevOps tasks for containerised deployment using Kubernetes and CI/CD.

- Implemented KrakenD API gateway and integrated Keycloak for managing client access via OAuth 2.0, enhancing security across our applications
- Developed a configuration migration library with a CLI for automating Keycloak deployments
- Contributed to core service enhancements by building functionality in our Java server and expanding our FastAPI server with new endpoints, database integrations, and rigorous testing
- Built a Flask-based client application simulator to validate API authentication and access, ensuring reliability before deployment
- Created a production-standard website for our documentation, including an OpenAPI spec for clients
- Contributed to key API design decisions, including architecture and Kubernetes deployment workflows

## Software Developer/Data Scientist, Accelogress (2020-2021)

### Client project 1

This company contracted Accelogress to conduct big data analytics on transport-related transactions across the city of Porto to better understand travel behaviour.

- Processed and analysed data with Apache Spark, Pandas, and SciPy
- Applied _k_\-means and density-based clustering with Scikit-Learn and hdbscan for advanced data segmentation
- Created insightful visualisations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate data findings effectively
- Data pipelineImplemented a data processing pipeline using Apache Airflow to automating our workflow

### Client project 2

This company contracted Accelogress to collaborate on building a cloud-hosted API for their users to submit remote computation requests to their quantum computing hardware. This implementation was the basis for a subsequent integration with AWS Bracket.

- Developed a Flask-based web API with PostgreSQL, incorporating WebSockets for real-time data processing
- Extended the API with message queuing to manage incoming remote execution tasks
- Created a Python software development kit (SDK) for users to interact programmatically with the API and submit requests efficiently

## Research Assistant, University of Surrey (2014-2020)

- Carried out neurostimulation (tDCS, TMS) research to investigate its use for post-stroke rehabilitation
- Collected mobile EEG data to study cognitive resource allocation during physical load-bearing
- Developed & carried out EEG research into belief bias in logical reasoning
- Collected, processed, & analysed fMRI data for a National Trust study

## Teaching Assistant, University of Surrey (2016, 2019-2020)

- Demonstrated & taught the use of physiological methods for psychological research
- Assisted students in understanding how to analyse data

# Education

## PhD Psychology & Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Surrey (2016-2022)

**Thesis**: _The influence of visual attention on memory encoding & recognition_

My focus was on the distinction between goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention, and how attention impacts memory encoding and later retrieval. I designed an experimental task that manipulated these modes of attention during memory encoding, which was then followed by a recognition test. With this, I ran experiments using behavioural measures, fMRI, and eye tracking. Due to disruptions from the COVID pandemic, I also carried out online research where I administered experimental tasks to study attention and memory. Finally, I wrote a Python library for calculating signal detection theory measures of cognition and to fit theoretical recognition memory models to empirical data.

- Utilised fMRI, eye tracking, and behavioural techniques to investigate attention and memory
- Applied descriptive and inferential statistics to real-world research questions, ensuring robust data analysis
- Programmed and implemented tasks to measure cognition, including recognition memory, visual attention, and working memory
- Developed a Python library to apply computational models of recognition memory to observed data
- Created automated pipelines in Python for data cleaning, visualisation, and statistical analysis
- Wrote Python scripts for eye tracking data processing and MATLAB pipelines for fMRI analysis, adhering to current research standards
- Employed machine learning (SVM, Scikit-Learn) to predict brain activity associated with memory encoding
- Assisted in supervising an undergraduate dissertation and regularly presented research findings in lab meetings

## MSc Research Methods in Psychology, University of Surrey (2013-2014)

**Thesis**: _Environmental context effects on recognition memory and its EEG correlates_

## BSc (Hons) Psychology, De Montfort University (2009-2012)

**Thesis**: _Mathematical training & susceptibility to cognitive biases_
